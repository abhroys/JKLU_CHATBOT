ARC (Applied Robotics Club) is more than just a club. It is a thriving community of passionate robotics enthusiasts dedicated to nurturing innovation and providing students with new resources to develop robots. The philosophy behind ARC is “of the student, for the student, and by the student.” While the club has been a success owing to the supportive faculties of JKLU, the inherent focus on student-driven initiatives and learning sets the stage for a new direction in learning and development.

We offer valuable guidance, hands-on workshops, and tutorials at well-equipped workspaces along with access to components and equipment to  ensure that the ideas of our students transform into reality.

–  Around the Year Activities

ARC hosts a variety of engaging activities throughout the year. These events bring together students from different universities to showcase their innovations and explore the latest industry trends in robotics.

– Beyond Robotics

Being a part of ARC means more than just working on robotics projects. It’s about learning valuable “life lessons” that extend beyond our club activities. As members, the students acquire skills and strategies that not only enhance their performance in events but also contribute to their personal growth as a whole.
