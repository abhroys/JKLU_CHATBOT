--- Experience ---
Dr. Mahesh Kumar Yadav is Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Institute of Engineering and Technology, JKLU. He obtained his PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Sameer Khandekar. He worked on understanding the long-term passive nuclear reactor containment cooling of Indian PHWR during his doctoral programme, an experiment- extensive work funded through two sponsored projects from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Mumbai, India.Dr. Yadav has more than 25 high-quality publications in international journals, national/ international conferences, and book chapters. He also serves as a reviewer in several international journals. He is a member of the prestigious American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), life member of the Indian Society for Heat and Mass Transfer (ISHMT), and The Institution of Engineers (India). His research interests include hydrogen management and mitigation, nuclear reactor containment cooling, phase-change thermo-fluidic systems, and inverse heat transfer measurements. Prior to joining the JKLU, he worked as Assistant Professor at Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Chandigarh, and Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering) Delhi.
