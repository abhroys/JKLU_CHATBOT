# About Club #

Step into the House of Arts, an enclave where creativity thrives and passions run deep. Drawing inspiration from Aristotle’s concept of “Catharsis – clearing out intense emotions,” our vision is to forge a haven that fosters a free expression of ideas and experiences.

JKLU Art Club understands the essential role of an artistic approach in navigating the intricacies of emotions and feelings. This is a place where individuals unite to unleash their inner artists and find synergy through collaborative projects. As they present the fruits of their creativity, they discover innovative solutions in the sanctuary of individual artistic practices.

Embark on this inclusive and fascination-driven odyssey with us, where art transcends traditional boundaries, and the only tangible reality is the limitless freedom to create. Join our community, where every stroke and every idea contributes to a collective masterpiece.


# Our Mission #

The Art club of JKLU envisions to create a thriving artist community in the university, where all creatives can come together to share their knowledge, learn new skills, and inspire one another. House of Arts is an excellent platform for students to showcase their talent, gain exposure, and build a network of like-minded individuals.
