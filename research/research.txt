1. Electric Power Generation using Agri-waste:The project aimed to utilize solar – Agri waste to generate electric power. This used Stirling Engine principle. The Agri waste was combusted outside the engine and the differential pressure was created. Utilizing this heat & ambient temperature condition, this engine is also categorized as an external combustion engine.2. Transparent Solar PV Panel for building windows:To utilize window glass area to generate electricity using solar energy. In this project, solar cells were planted on the window glass in such a way that the part of the window is transmitting sunlight and part is generating electric power to meet the lighting requirement windows.3.Development of Set-up for Selection of Alternative Heat Transfer Fluids for Direct Absorption of Solar Energy:The photo thermal property is very important for the assessment of solar energy absorption as it directly reflects the ability to convert light energy to thermal energy for heat transfer fluids. Hence, the photo thermal properties of alternative heat transfer fluids were investigated. Variety of nonmaterial was used for different thermal applications for efficiency enhancement and improved heat transfer.4. Concentrated Solar Photo Voltaic Collector:The parabolic through the reflector, when used as an electric power energy collector, is constructed as a long parabolic reflecting mirror which is usually painted a reflective silver. Concentrated solar power systems generate solar power by using solar over cells or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area. In this project, the mirror is replaced with solar cells to increase its efficiency.5. Alexa based Voice based Application for Elderly People:This project focuses on developing an Alexa skill that could help the elderly with their routines. The skill developed successfully identifies a user and remember to remind some specific tasks that could come handy to the elderly users.6.Smart Dustbin System with Raspberry Kit:The real-time waste management system has been implemented by using smart dustbins to check the fill level of smart dustbins whether the dustbins are full or not. In this system, the information of all smart dustbins can be accessed from anywhere and anytime by the concerned person and he/ she can take a decision accordingly. By implementing this proposed system, the cost reduction, resource optimization, effective usage of smart dustbin scan bed one.7. Bag Tracking Software:GPS enabled Bag Tracking Software for Postal Services This project deals with real-time bag tracking and alert system by monitoring the Package’s location at a given interval of time. Whenever the user requests the location of his parcel the last updated location of the parcel will be provided to him. The use of GPS (Global Positioning System) gives us the accessibility to track the package on the real-time location of their parcel whenever they wish to. The determination of the location takes place via the GPS which sends its location using a GSM after a given interval of time and updates it in the main database. Whenever the user requests the location of the parcel is searched on the Google Maps on the website of Indian Post. If the expected date of delivery exceeds then an alert message will be displayed on the website. The idea proposed by the project team is economically feasible, innovative and sustainable.8. “Waste Water Treatment using Fresnel Lens and Scope of Small Scale Electricity Generation”. :The team comprised of Mr Arsalano Baidi and Mr Gourav Suthar who were supervised by faculty mentors consisting of Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas, Amit Kumar and Dr Shanawaz Khan. The financial support for this research project was done through Director’s fund allocated by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Anupam Kumar Singh.The current research was to review the use of Fresnel lenses for the water treatment process. The Fresnel lenses are a good and economical option for solar concentration and solar heating. Many parts of the world have an immense source of solar energy which provides a good platform to use Fresnel lens for wastewater treatment by converting it into steam and then further condensing it to get pure watermarking all safe water parameters (pH, Dissolve Oxygen, Total Hardness etc.). A lab-scale working model water treatment plant was designed and tested.9. A new configuration of solar panel was developed. The salient feature of the panel is shown in the following picture:The above solar PV panel was designed, fabricated and tested. These panels can be put practically anywhere without the requirement of a flat roof or unusable land. We can do farming under these solar power generators. These can be even placed in the median of the highways.10. GAGAN and GIS for estimation & verification of small reservoir storage in the upper Chambal river basinThe project supported by Space Applications Centre (SAC) Ahmedabad/ ISRO partially was to research the data collection reliability, robustness and accuracy as part of field trials of the NAVIC system based on the constellation of 7 indigenous satellites launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).The project was extended to the topographic mapping of water bodies in the Chambal basin region, and estimation of volumes of water with relation to time. This project is proposed to be further extended during 2019-2022 to investigate applications of satellite technologies for the agricultural sector in active collaboration with industry (Dr Jyoti Prakash Naidu, Dr Gustavo Sanchez).11. Electric Vehicle ‘Lightning 16’There are different tasks involved in the fabrication of a vehicle and different systems inherently working together. Thus, 5 groups were formed to achieve the following objectives. Power Generation System Transmission and Steering System Suspensions and Wheels System Braking Systems Design and Fabrication of Chassis Advantages of Electric Vehicle: Less Complexity; Less Maintenance; More Efficient; Increased Longevity; Sustainability; and Eco-friendly.

Automated Restaurant System using AtMega328 MicrocontrollerIn this AtMega328 Microcontroller is used. There will be one keyboard and display on the customer table from where he will order and the information will go to the cook, he will prepare the food and will put on the conveyer belt and food will automatically come to the customer table.5. Arduino based health monitoring system using IoTIn this, the heartbeat sensor and temp sensor will be used to sense the heartbeat and human body temp. this info will go to the doctor and his family continuously using IOT. In the emergency the doctor can take appropriate decision.6. Robotic Hand with Wireless Glove ControlIn this, a robotic hand is there that is controlled by human hand. There will be some sensor to control the robotic hand. Robotic hand can be used to clean the sewer line or in fire case where human cannot reach.7. Hidden Active Cellphone DetectorIn this project, there will be a model that will be used to detect the Cellular frequency.
