Serving as Deputy General Secretary of the university's Student Council for 1.5+ years allowed me to hone my leadership skills and manage a team. I'm grateful to the university's excellent faculty and management. Achieving the highest CTC in my batch, that too in the first company was impossible without the guidance of the faculty and never-ending hard work of the placement team. JKLU has a great campus life, with various clubs that offer a platform to explore one's interests."

The university has provided me with a platform to believe in the phrase, ‘Sky's the limit’. In my first-year, I became the Vice-President of the Media club and the Event coordinator of Sabrang. I got the opportunity to do multiple internships where the corporate culture knowledge imparted by our professors helped me to earn a place on the honours list during my 1st year BBA."

 Proud and Honoured to be Accredited with ‘A’ Grade by NAAC   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In April 2022, JKLU went through the process of assessment and accreditation by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council). There were 7 assessment criteria which we had to comply with in order to get a NAAC accreditation. These were: Curricular Aspects Teaching, Learning and Evaluation Research, Consultancy and Extension Infrastructure and Learning Resources Student Support and Progression Governance, Leadership and Management Innovations and Best Practices   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The expert team from NAAC critically examined JKLU on all these parameters and awarded a prestigious ’A’ Grade equivalent to a CGPA of 3.05. The grade not only reflects our hard work and perseverance, but also our aspirations and commitment to quality and excellence. ‘A’ Grade by NAAC will now propel us to work even harder in future to impart the best education to our students and ensure that the knowledge gained thereof is used to create a better tomorrow.

 Creating bridges between curiosity and knowledge.   
 
 Research   
 
 
 
 Research is vital for the success of any global endeavour and is the foundation of development and policies all over the world. The research draws its power from the fact that it is empirical: rather than merely theorizing about what might be effective or what could work. Quality research results are examinable, replicable, and the knowledge generated applies to real-world situations.

 Research is vital for the success of any global endeavour and is the foundation of development and policies all over the world. The research draws its power from the fact that it is empirical: rather than merely theorizing about what might be effective or what could work. Quality research results are examinable, replicable, and the knowledge generated applies to real-world situations.

 1. Electric Power Generation using Agri-waste: The project aimed to utilize solar – Agri waste to generate electric power. This used Stirling Engine principle. The Agri waste was combusted outside the engine and the differential pressure was created. Utilizing this heat & ambient temperature condition, this engine is also categorized as an external combustion engine. 2. Transparent Solar PV Panel for building windows: To utilize window glass area to generate electricity using solar energy. In this project, solar cells were planted on the window glass in such a way that the part of the window is transmitting sunlight and part is generating electric power to meet the lighting requirement windows. 3.   Development of Set-up for Selection of Alternative Heat Transfer Fluids for Direct Absorption of Solar Energy: The photo thermal property is very important for the assessment of solar energy absorption as it directly reflects the ability to convert light energy to thermal energy for heat transfer fluids. Hence, the photo thermal properties of alternative heat transfer fluids were investigated. Variety of nonmaterial was used for different thermal applications for efficiency enhancement and improved heat transfer. 4. Concentrated Solar Photo Voltaic Collector: The parabolic through the reflector, when used as an electric power energy collector, is constructed as a long parabolic reflecting mirror which is usually painted a reflective silver. Concentrated solar power systems generate solar power by using solar over cells or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area. In this project, the mirror is replaced with solar cells to increase its efficiency. 5. Alexa based Voice based Application for Elderly People: This project focuses on developing an Alexa skill that could help the elderly with their routines. The skill developed successfully identifies a user and remember to remind some specific tasks that could come handy to the elderly users. 6.Smart Dustbin System with Raspberry Kit:  The real-time waste management system has been implemented by using smart dustbins to check the fill level of smart dustbins whether the dustbins are full or not. In this system, the information of all smart dustbins can be accessed from anywhere and anytime by the concerned person and he/ she can take a decision accordingly. By implementing this proposed system, the cost reduction, resource optimization, effective usage of smart dustbin scan bed one. 7. Bag Tracking Software:  GPS enabled Bag Tracking Software for Postal Services This project deals with real-time bag tracking and alert system by monitoring the Package’s location at a given interval of time. Whenever the user requests the location of his parcel the last updated location of the parcel will be provided to him. The use of GPS (Global Positioning System) gives us the accessibility to track the package on the real-time location of their parcel whenever they wish to. The determination of the location takes place via the GPS which sends its location using a GSM after a given interval of time and updates it in the main database. Whenever the user requests the location of the parcel is searched on the Google Maps on the website of Indian Post. If the expected date of delivery exceeds then an alert message will be displayed on the website. The idea proposed by the project team is economically feasible, innovative and sustainable. 8. “Waste Water Treatment using Fresnel Lens and Scope of Small Scale Electricity Generation”. : The team comprised of Mr Arsalano Baidi and Mr Gourav Suthar who were supervised by faculty mentors consisting of Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas, Amit Kumar and Dr Shanawaz Khan. The financial support for this research project was done through Director’s fund allocated by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Anupam Kumar Singh. The current research was to review the use of Fresnel lenses for the water treatment process. The Fresnel lenses are a good and economical option for solar concentration and solar heating. Many parts of the world have an immense source of solar energy which provides a good platform to use Fresnel lens for wastewater treatment by converting it into steam and then further condensing it to get pure watermarking all safe water parameters (pH, Dissolve Oxygen, Total Hardness etc.). A lab-scale working model water treatment plant was designed and tested. 9. A new configuration of solar panel was developed. The salient feature of the panel is shown in the following picture: The above solar PV panel was designed, fabricated and tested. These panels can be put practically anywhere without the requirement of a flat roof or unusable land. We can do farming under these solar power generators. These can be even placed in the median of the highways. 10. GAGAN and GIS for estimation & verification of small reservoir storage in the upper Chambal river basin The project supported by Space Applications Centre (SAC) Ahmedabad/ ISRO partially was to research the data collection reliability, robustness and accuracy as part of field trials of the NAVIC system based on the constellation of 7 indigenous satellites launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The project was extended to the topographic mapping of water bodies in the Chambal basin region, and estimation of volumes of water with relation to time. This project is proposed to be further extended during 2019-2022 to investigate applications of satellite technologies for the agricultural sector in active collaboration with industry (Dr Jyoti Prakash Naidu, Dr Gustavo Sanchez). 11. Electric Vehicle ‘Lightning 16’ There are different tasks involved in the fabrication of a vehicle and different systems inherently working together. Thus, 5 groups were formed to achieve the following objectives. Power Generation System Transmission and Steering System Suspensions and Wheels System Braking Systems Design and Fabrication of Chassis Advantages of Electric Vehicle: Less Complexity; Less Maintenance; More Efficient; Increased Longevity; Sustainability; and Eco-friendly.

 "Although JKLU has the best of everything a student could ask for, the most noteworthy are the faculty members who possess great wisdom and deep knowledge about their fields, including memorable stories and experiences to share. An optimum student to faculty ratio establishes strong bonds between the mentors and students where they acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses thereby learning new skills and attributes."

 "As a JKLU student, I've had an incredible experience. Thanks to my professors and mentors, I've developed a diverse set of skills, including technical knowledge, communication, leadership, and critical thinking. Serving as Deputy General Secretary of the university's Student Council for 1.5+ years allowed me to hone my leadership skills and manage a team. 

I'm grateful to the university's excellent faculty and management. Achieving the highest CTC in my batch, that too in the first company was impossible without the guidance of the faculty and never-ending hard work of the placement team. JKLU has a great campus life, with various clubs that offer a platform to explore one's interests."

 JKLU has provided me with an intriguing, fulfilling, and challenging experience. My engagement has been a tremendous experience that includes academics, an interdisciplinary approach, quality education, exceptional book collections, and cutting-edge labs.

In my opinion, the miraculous thing about JKLU is the way they treat their students giving them exposure to develop their individuality. With the best potential placements and outstanding experience, our campus provided me wings to thrive in every aspect of my course.
Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone, so I expressed my gratitude by serving as the general secretary of the student council (2021-22). I am really obliged to JKLU and truly beholden to them for always believing in me and allowing me to grow and become more versatile.

                                        Embedded Systems and IoT                 
 
 
 Embedded system developers write code that powers refrigerators, printers, ovens, or toasters that makes everyone’s life easier. The embedded coding runs before the operating system even loads. These developers work on the operating system in real-time and write the real hardware code to function correctly. They work closely with hardware engineers because they write device drivers. Embedded system developers can look forward to a bright future. Qualcomm, Intel, Tata Elxsi, HCL Technologies all of these companies hire embedded software engineers.   Simultaneously, IoT is making significant strides as more things are getting connected to the internet. Many experts predict that two-third of the new businesses will be dependent on IoT by the end of this year. Keeping this in mind, IoT offers the potential for a “fourth industrial revolution.” IoT ecosystem consists of intelligent devices that are web-enabled and use embedded systems such as sensors, processors, and communication hardware that collect the information and then share, analyse the data they collect and then act on it. The data obtained by the sensors of an IoT in the environment is shared by connecting to an IoT gateway that sends the data to the cloud for analysis. The data is analysed locally. These devices can often connect to similar devices and share the information and then act on the data they acquire from each other.

                                        Cloud Computing                 
 
 
 Cloud computing (or ‘on-demand computing’) is a key distributed systems paradigm which has been gained much attention during the last few years. Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing, where data, information and shared resources are made available to computers and other devices on-demand. Cloud technologies are ubiquitous, affecting our routine lives any moment we access the World Wide Web, use a mobile app, or go for online transactions. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with numerous competencies to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Cloud computing is a model for facilitating pervasive, suitable, on-demand network access to a common pool of configurable computing resources such as webs, servers, storage, applications and services that can be quickly provisioned and freed with nominal management effort.   Cloud computing offers many job types, from administrator roles to development-focused opportunities. Cloud-based systems contain huge amounts of data, making security essential. Jobs typically consist of making and implementing security strategies both internally and in partnership with cloud service providers in addition to monitoring systems for potential threats. Industry with its own regulatory protocols, such as healthcare or government need to integrate those security procedures into company’s cloud system. Cloud software engineers, specialise in developing software based on cloud service architectures and their underlying systems.   Some of the common jobs in this field are: System Engineer Security Administrator Cloud Security Engineer

 About the programme   
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The success of an enterprise is dependent on its foundation and its ability to adapt to change. The last two decades have seen significant change in business models, driven by innovative tech and design. Start-ups and agile players have created new industries or ways of life (Uber, Whatsapp), and gained significant market share from established companies (e-tailers like Flipkart). Fintech (PayTM, Zerodha) has been at the core of creating new-age customer experiences. 
   
 India has been at the forefront of these changes with 100+ unicorns, as well as digital payment products that are the best in the world (UPI, IMPS, etc.), which are so good that they are being adapted by other countries. 
   
 The BBA programme at JKLU believes in providing learners a strong foundation in core management, new-age skills (communications, critical thinking, entrepreneurial mindset, etc.) and focused specializations that ensure that they are job-ready when they graduate. The Indian economy is expected to be the fastest growing in the world, and we are making sure that our graduates will make best use of the emerging opportunities. 
   
 Our specializations 
   
 
 BBA Banking & Fintech : Digitization has completely transformed the way India banks and pays. Our industry-integrated programme ensures our students learn new-age Banking and Fintech from the industry experts. Our unique internships, after the 2 nd  year and in the 6 th  semester, ensure our students learn in real-life corporate environments and are truly job-ready when they graduate. Among our industry partners are India’s premier digital bank (awarded as the most Innovative Bank of the Year), one of the largest non-banking finance companies in India, a leading affordable housing finance company, and many others. 
 
   
 
 BBA Entrepreneurship : An entrepreneurial mindset distinguishes the best professionals from the average. Our BBA Entrepreneurship programme provides an opportunity to earn a degree and be an entrepreneur at the same time. This programme includes learning at JKLU’s unique Start-up Studio, access to our Atal Incubation Centre setup with Niti Aayog, and the only  BizLab  in Rajasthan, in collaboration with All India Management Association. 
 
   
 
 BBA Interdisciplinary : This unique programme offers a core management foundation, new-age skills, and a choice of courses from technology and design, coupled with a flexible choice of specialization. Students learn from the best-in-class industry experts and experienced faculty, understand how the interplay of technology and design is changing customer experiences, and emerge as versatile graduates ready to take on any role in the new-age economy.

 “I personally believe that JKLU is a  nurturing one-step destination. The university has provided me with a platform to believe in the phrase, ‘Sky's the limit’. In my first-year, I became the Vice-President of the Media club and the Event coordinator of Sabrang. I got the opportunity to do multiple internships where the corporate culture knowledge imparted by our professors helped me to earn a place on the honours list during my 1st year BBA."

 “One thing which really attracted me towards JKLU was their specialisation in BBA which helps one to find a niche in the particular field of study. It has been one year for me at JKLU and during this time, I have learnt a lot of things and hope to learn a lot more in the coming years too. In the first year itself, we were given a chance to do internships. I never faced any difficulty here in terms of faculty and studies.”

 “JKLU has helped me to develop my personality as well as knowledge and skills through training given by the Institute of Management. Here, we are not only focusing on the theoretical aspects of management but also on the implementation of theory in the practical business world. The BBA programme has enhanced my confidence and management skills while improving my personality to face the challenges of the business world. "

 “In my opinion as a BBA graduate from JK Lakshmipat University, the key differentiator about the programme is that it motivates students to reach the apex of their personal abilities by challenging them academically and professionally. Having access to guidance from AIC professors who care passionately about what they teach and use real world examples throughout their courses helped me to implement social projects in Atma Nirbhar Bharat."

 Hans-Bernd Kittlaus



   
 
 
 
 Chairman, ISPMA (International Software Product Management Association     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “The software product management (SPM) role is pretty well established in software organisations. The role is now getting established in more and more industries. They are realising that software is becoming the no. 1 value driver in their products.”   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 Spurthy Dharanikota   
 
 
 
 

Assistant Professor, Information  Systems, IIM Bangalore

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Recently, I asked my PGP students what they are looking for in placements, almost 70% said product management. It’s the highest paying job, almost. Data science has been called the sexiest job of the 21st century, but I think it’s being slowly replaced by product management.”   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 Haragopal Mangipudi   
 
 
 
 Global Board Member, ISPMA Former Head, Infosys Finacle   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Some 15-30 years back, it was said every board should have a chartered accountant from a risk perspective. Now, you need a digital product manager on every board, because they have a digital manifestation and engagement with customers.”

This scholarship will be in addition to the merit scholarship mentioned earlier, subject to a maximum of 100 percent.

The 10 percent women's scholarship will be ongoing for all eligible women who do not receive any other scholarship, provided they maintain a minimum CGPA of 6.0.

 Disciplinary Committee 
 The disciplinary committee and the unfair means committee hold the authority to propose a reduction or discontinuation of a scholarship if a student is found culpable of breaching academic integrity (such as copying or assisting others in assignments, projects, exams, etc., or engaging in plagiarism or similar acts) or violating disciplinary norms (including theft, fighting, property defacement, substance abuse, etc.). In the initial instance, the scholarship will default to a lower level, and it will be entirely revoked after a second violation. However, these committees retain the discretion to recommend no impact on the scholarship (if deeming charges as minor violations) or suggest scholarship removal in the first instance itself (if charges are considered serious).

 JK Lakshmipat University is ‘A’ Grade Accredited by NAAC. The university offers innovation-led study programmes that are backed by student-centric pedagogy and integrated learning. The multitude of undergraduate, graduate, and PhD programmes in Engineering, Management, and Design allow students valuable access and exposure to the Incubation Centres, Centres of Excellence, state-of-the-art laboratories, and world-class faculty at JKLU campus. The university also offers lateral entry to external students who wish to take a transfer from their present institution after completing the 1st year or the 2nd year of their undergraduate study programme.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Transfer to JKLU   
 
 
 
 This academic session, we plan to admit a small group of transfer students to B.Tech., BCA, BBA, and B.Des. programmes as there are limited seats available in these highly competitive and sought-after courses. The transfer students would need to fulfil the eligibility criteria requisite of their chosen programme of study. Our Lateral Admission allows the students flexibility in course selection while reviewing his/her ability to pursue the course programme of their choice. We are now accepting applications for lateral entry to our undergraduate programmes for the Academic Year 2022-23. Apply now and benefit from the JKLU edge and NAAC advantage. Students who have successfully completed one or two years at an educational institution in India may apply for Lateral Admission.

 Placements at a Glance   
 
 
 
 We at JKLU take pride in our students and their endeavours. Every year, our career guidance and placement department assists them in exploring new and exciting career options to make informed choices. The department organises industry visits and numerous on-campus symposia for the outgoing students of our three institutes of Engineering, Management, and Design that create opportunities for them to interact with prospective recruiters and allow them to make inroads into unexplored sectors and fields. Periodic campus interviews are integral to the recruitment process at JKLU that follow multiple pre- placement discussions between the students and prospective recruiters. This allows the students valuable insight into a specific organisation, the company’s vision and mission as well as the details of the job applied for. The final selection process involves group discussions, interviews, and assignments where staff and elected student members of the placement committee work to make the recruitment process systematic and seamless. We are a NAAC ‘A’ grade accredited university that offers quality education along with assured placements across industry sectors. The proactive academic-industry relationship nurtured over time further allows our students to secure the best jobs and pursue promising careers across a wide spectrum of choice.

 "I am delighted to share my college experience with you all. Throughout my time at JK lakshmipat University, I have been privileged to be part of an institution that has truly shaped my personal and academic growth. JKLU is not just about academics; it is a vibrant and dynamic community. The campus is filled with opportunities for extracurricular involvement, including clubs, organisations, and events catering to a wide range of interests. These activities have allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals, develop leadership skills, and create lifelong friendships. The college's commitment to holistic education has nurtured my personal growth and helped me become a well-rounded individual. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities, knowledge, and relationships I have gained during my time here. Jklu has prepared me not only for a successful career but also for a meaningful and fulfilling life. I am proud to be a part of this incredible institution and will carry the memories and lessons learned with me always."

 At JKLU, the Department of Student Affairs collaborates with the elected student members of the Student Council to extend assistance on issues pertaining to the general welfare of students. The council works to make resources freely accessible to everyone and build a welcoming atmosphere for both personal and professional development of the students. The office of student affairs is actively involved in community development and to achieve this aim, numerous student initiatives and programs are now being adopted. The student council constitutes a committed group of students from the Institutes of Engineering and Technology, Management, and Design. All the elected members of the council diligently carry out their assigned duties and responsibilities with the aim to strengthen the relationship between the students and the administration.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Objective   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
				The objectives of the Student Council are many fold:
 
 To advocate the interests of the students to the administration and vice versa. 
 Establish an environment where every student can express his/ her needs and concerns. 
 To provide a platform where the students can confidently display their talent. 
 The student council is also responsible for overseeing the efficient planning and operation of all university- related activities, events, clubs, residence halls, meals, and transportation. 
 
 This year's guiding idea is inclusion of all, not only in terms of participation but also ideation and execution.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Student Council 2023-24   
 
 
 
 The JKLU Student Council is unique this year. Nearly equal participation of girls and boys (32 girls and 24 boys) in the newly elected 56-member council is a heartwarming development and an inspiring reminder of an egalitarian society. Adding to this, the council also has a good representation from all the three institutions (Engineering and technology, Management and Design) and batches (19 students from the third year, 16 students from the second year, and 15 students from the first year). Six sub-domains make up the Student Council 2023–24, each of which is managed by a General Secretary and Secretary with full support from the Council President. To make living and studying at JKLU enjoyable and comfortable, the six sub- councils collaborate closely with the administration and serve as representatives of the student body.

 Creating bridges between curiosity and knowledge.   
 
 Research   
 
 
 
 Research is vital for the success of any global endeavour and is the foundation of development and policies all over the world. The research draws its power from the fact that it is empirical: rather than merely theorizing about what might be effective or what could work. Quality research results are examinable, replicable, and the knowledge generated applies to real-world situations.

 The Centre for Communication and Critical Thinking (CCCT) is a key innovation of JK Lakshmipat University that uses the constructs of liberal arts, scientific temperament, group dynamics, and interpersonal communication to help students achieve personal and professional growth. Firstly, CCCT supplements the students’ learning and growth journey through credited courses, communication labs, and diverse events. Six unique courses that focus on the capacity building of students across the areas of communication, critical thinking, negotiation, problem-solving, and decision making, have been duly developed by the Centre. These learning pathways are offered as core courses across the three institutes, alongside the discipline-specific courses for all programmes. An Active Learning Approach is used to teach these courses. This involves various activities that encourage students to undertake tasks so as to practice and develop their skills, as opposed to passive learning, where information is simply passed on to them. Besides the courses, students attend 10-12 hours of compulsory Communication Laboratory, where they practice thinking, writing, and speaking. Personalised learning pedagogy is used to help each student improve their writing and speaking abilities over time. The formats that are used to conduct the lab sessions include: Reading Circles | Think                           Focused Groups | Write    Public Speaking | Speak    Open Office Hours |Mentor    The third important aspect of CCCT is the Events. The Centre regularly organises events that create awareness among students and offer them exposure to diverse topics through an external interface, including expert talks, workshops, and field visits. The students are also encouraged to organise these events to help them build confidence and improve their organisational and communication skills. CCCT’s contribution towards capacity building among students is acknowledged by our alumni as one of the most important aspects that has helped them become better professionals in their chosen fields. In a student perception survey conducted by the Centre, majority of them agreed that their presentation, confidence, and thinking skills have greatly improved due to CCCT interventions. The students’ testimony is further supported by the skill enhancement displayed by them during summer internships and in their final placements, which is extremely encouraging. CCCT initiative, along with other academic practices of the university, have not only lead to augmenting the job preparedness of our students, but have also prepared them for life in general. The Centre for Communication and Critical Thinking acts as a Conscience Keeper by safeguarding the values enshrined by JK Lakshmipat University, for a better citizenry.

			Design education has to move away from schools of Art and Architecture and move into the schools of Science and Engineering. We need new kinds of Designers, people who can work across disciplines, who understand human beings, business, and technology and the appropriate means of validating claims.
     
-Don Norman		 
 
 
 
 
 
   … And inspired by Don Norman’s quote, the Institute of Design at JKLU came up in 2019. Today, the Institute is ranked among the best in the country with well curated courses in design that are backed by a curriculum geared to empower you with a designer’s mindset along with the tools and skills required to usher in a technology-led future.

 What We Do?   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We create designers who are  creative, mature, independent, empathetic, sensitive, conscious, resourceful, and communicative . To achieve this, we have re-imagined the curriculum to make way for new skills, new methods of working, and new pedagogy. Our endeavour is to  make you proficient in analogue as well as digital skills, in traditional as well as contemporary aspects of design . At the Institute of Design, you learn to  collaborate and work with different professionals like engineers, sociologists, and behavioural scientists . Access to Hi-tech scientific labs in IoT and robotics,  maker studios and media labs, computing resources  to build apps and interfaces, enables you to conceptualise and work on a variety of projects that are not possible in most conventional design schools. An  award-wining, young, and dynamic faculty  and the best of visiting faculty facilitate the best possible learning for you.

 Research is vital for the success of any global endeavour and is the foundation of development and policies all over the world. The research draws its power from the fact that it is empirical: rather than merely theorizing about what might be effective or what could work. Quality research results are examinable, replicable, and the knowledge generated applies to real-world situations.

The current research was to review the use of Fresnel lenses for the water treatment process. The Fresnel lenses are a good and economical option for solar concentration and solar heating. Many parts of the world have an immense source of solar energy which provides a good platform to use Fresnel lens for wastewater treatment by converting it into steam and then further condensing it to get pure watermarking all safe water parameters (pH, Dissolve Oxygen, Total Hardness etc.). A lab-scale working model water treatment plant was designed and tested. 9. A new configuration of solar panel was developed. The salient feature of the panel is shown in the following picture: The above solar PV panel was designed, fabricated and tested. These panels can be put practically anywhere without the requirement of a flat roof or unusable land. We can do farming under these solar power generators. These can be even placed in the median of the highways. 10.

 "Although JKLU has the best of everything a student could ask for, the most noteworthy are the faculty members who possess great wisdom and deep knowledge about their fields, including memorable stories and experiences to share. An optimum student to faculty ratio establishes strong bonds between the mentors and students where they acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses thereby learning new skills and attributes."

 "As a JKLU student, I've had an incredible experience. Thanks to my professors and mentors, I've developed a diverse set of skills, including technical knowledge, communication, leadership, and critical thinking. Serving as Deputy General Secretary of the university's Student Council for 1.5+ years allowed me to hone my leadership skills and manage a team. 

I'm grateful to the university's excellent faculty and management. Achieving the highest CTC in my batch, that too in the first company was impossible without the guidance of the faculty and never-ending hard work of the placement team. JKLU has a great campus life, with various clubs that offer a platform to explore one's interests."

 My experience at JKLU has been truly transformative. The university has provided me with a wonderful opportunity to learn and grow intellectually, socially, and academically. With project-based learning and dedicated professors, I was able to apply practical knowledge in real-time and develop valuable experience while working in a team. I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to learn about emerging technologies such as AI and ML, which have become increasingly relevant in today's world. What's more, 

JKLU has a vibrant and supportive community that offers social and moral support in addition to a rich technological and cultural environment. Overall, I am incredibly appreciative of my experience at JKLU and the chances it has given me to widen my personal and professional horizons.

 JKLU has provided me with an intriguing, fulfilling, and challenging experience. My engagement has been a tremendous experience that includes academics, an interdisciplinary approach, quality education, exceptional book collections, and cutting-edge labs.

In my opinion, the miraculous thing about JKLU is the way they treat their students giving them exposure to develop their individuality. With the best potential placements and outstanding experience, our campus provided me wings to thrive in every aspect of my course.
Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone, so I expressed my gratitude by serving as the general secretary of the student council (2021-22). I am really obliged to JKLU and truly beholden to them for always believing in me and allowing me to grow and become more versatile.

                                        Embedded Systems and IoT                 
 
 
 Embedded system developers write code that powers refrigerators, printers, ovens, or toasters that makes everyone’s life easier. The embedded coding runs before the operating system even loads. These developers work on the operating system in real-time and write the real hardware code to function correctly. They work closely with hardware engineers because they write device drivers. Embedded system developers can look forward to a bright future. Qualcomm, Intel, Tata Elxsi, HCL Technologies all of these companies hire embedded software engineers.   Simultaneously, IoT is making significant strides as more things are getting connected to the internet. Many experts predict that two-third of the new businesses will be dependent on IoT by the end of this year. Keeping this in mind, IoT offers the potential for a “fourth industrial revolution.” IoT ecosystem consists of intelligent devices that are web-enabled and use embedded systems such as sensors, processors, and communication hardware that collect the information and then share, analyse the data they collect and then act on it. The data obtained by the sensors of an IoT in the environment is shared by connecting to an IoT gateway that sends the data to the cloud for analysis. The data is analysed locally. These devices can often connect to similar devices and share the information and then act on the data they acquire from each other.

                                        Cloud Computing                 
 
 
 Cloud computing (or ‘on-demand computing’) is a key distributed systems paradigm which has been gained much attention during the last few years. Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing, where data, information and shared resources are made available to computers and other devices on-demand. Cloud technologies are ubiquitous, affecting our routine lives any moment we access the World Wide Web, use a mobile app, or go for online transactions. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with numerous competencies to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Cloud computing is a model for facilitating pervasive, suitable, on-demand network access to a common pool of configurable computing resources such as webs, servers, storage, applications and services that can be quickly provisioned and freed with nominal management effort.   Cloud computing offers many job types, from administrator roles to development-focused opportunities. Cloud-based systems contain huge amounts of data, making security essential. Jobs typically consist of making and implementing security strategies both internally and in partnership with cloud service providers in addition to monitoring systems for potential threats. Industry with its own regulatory protocols, such as healthcare or government need to integrate those security procedures into company’s cloud system. Cloud software engineers, specialise in developing software based on cloud service architectures and their underlying systems.   Some of the common jobs in this field are: System Engineer Security Administrator Cloud Security Engineer

 Product Design ( M.Des )   
 
 
 
 2 year composite study programme that combines new age domains with traditional approaches to learning   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   ABOUT THE PROGRAMME This programme is predominantly hands-on as it follows the ‘learning by doing’ routine. Project based learning prepares you for a career that is both inspiring and invigorating. The programme allows exposure to all media and related software, and work on design assignments that define the nature of many career options. With time, the nature of communication design has changed significantly in the information economy. Content production has now become primarily digital. While the internet has given the power of creating content to one and all, consuming content has become cursory and transient. From analog print magazines to digitally enhanced videos, more communication designers are now needed to negotiate different domains who are strategic thinkers, techno mavericks and uber-creative professionals.

 JK Lakshmipat University is ‘A’ Grade Accredited by NAAC. The university offers innovation-led study programmes that are backed by student-centric pedagogy and integrated learning. The multitude of undergraduate, graduate, and PhD programmes in Engineering, Management, and Design allow students valuable access and exposure to the Incubation Centres, Centres of Excellence, state-of-the-art laboratories, and world-class faculty at JKLU campus. The university also offers lateral entry to external students who wish to take a transfer from their present institution after completing the 1st year or the 2nd year of their undergraduate study programme.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Transfer to JKLU   
 
 
 
 This academic session, we plan to admit a small group of transfer students to B.Tech., BCA, BBA, and B.Des. programmes as there are limited seats available in these highly competitive and sought-after courses. The transfer students would need to fulfil the eligibility criteria requisite of their chosen programme of study. Our Lateral Admission allows the students flexibility in course selection while reviewing his/her ability to pursue the course programme of their choice. We are now accepting applications for lateral entry to our undergraduate programmes for the Academic Year 2022-23. Apply now and benefit from the JKLU edge and NAAC advantage. Students who have successfully completed one or two years at an educational institution in India may apply for Lateral Admission.

 Placements at a Glance   
 
 
 
 We at JKLU take pride in our students and their endeavours. Every year, our career guidance and placement department assists them in exploring new and exciting career options to make informed choices. The department organises industry visits and numerous on-campus symposia for the outgoing students of our three institutes of Engineering, Management, and Design that create opportunities for them to interact with prospective recruiters and allow them to make inroads into unexplored sectors and fields. Periodic campus interviews are integral to the recruitment process at JKLU that follow multiple pre- placement discussions between the students and prospective recruiters. This allows the students valuable insight into a specific organisation, the company’s vision and mission as well as the details of the job applied for. The final selection process involves group discussions, interviews, and assignments where staff and elected student members of the placement committee work to make the recruitment process systematic and seamless. We are a NAAC ‘A’ grade accredited university that offers quality education along with assured placements across industry sectors. The proactive academic-industry relationship nurtured over time further allows our students to secure the best jobs and pursue promising careers across a wide spectrum of choice.

 At JKLU, the Department of Student Affairs collaborates with the elected student members of the Student Council to extend assistance on issues pertaining to the general welfare of students. The council works to make resources freely accessible to everyone and build a welcoming atmosphere for both personal and professional development of the students. The office of student affairs is actively involved in community development and to achieve this aim, numerous student initiatives and programs are now being adopted. The student council constitutes a committed group of students from the Institutes of Engineering and Technology, Management, and Design. All the elected members of the council diligently carry out their assigned duties and responsibilities with the aim to strengthen the relationship between the students and the administration.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Objective   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
				The objectives of the Student Council are many fold:
 
 To advocate the interests of the students to the administration and vice versa. 
 Establish an environment where every student can express his/ her needs and concerns. 
 To provide a platform where the students can confidently display their talent. 
 The student council is also responsible for overseeing the efficient planning and operation of all university- related activities, events, clubs, residence halls, meals, and transportation. 
 
 This year's guiding idea is inclusion of all, not only in terms of participation but also ideation and execution.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Student Council 2023-24   
 
 
 
 The JKLU Student Council is unique this year. Nearly equal participation of girls and boys (32 girls and 24 boys) in the newly elected 56-member council is a heartwarming development and an inspiring reminder of an egalitarian society. Adding to this, the council also has a good representation from all the three institutions (Engineering and technology, Management and Design) and batches (19 students from the third year, 16 students from the second year, and 15 students from the first year). Six sub-domains make up the Student Council 2023–24, each of which is managed by a General Secretary and Secretary with full support from the Council President. To make living and studying at JKLU enjoyable and comfortable, the six sub- councils collaborate closely with the administration and serve as representatives of the student body.

 At JK Lakshmipat University, we recognize that student life can be both enriching and challenging, often involving adaptation to new environments, deadline management, and complex social interactions. To assist our students, we offer 'Mindery,' an on-campus counseling service aimed at helping students manage anxiety and adjust effectively to campus life. Mindery Technologies provides these counseling services, which are confidential and available during designated hours. Mindery offers 24/7 online access, with in-person counseling available every Thursday from 9 AM to 5 PM. Students must pre-book their 45-minute sessions via a weekly campus life email. We uphold strict confidentiality and take immediate action if necessary. Additionally, Mindery conducts both online and offline educational sessions on mental health to boost students' self-awareness and confidence. Our in-house counselor, Ms. Pallavee Sharma, Senior Executive - Wellness (Student Affairs), is a Counseling Psychologist and Art Therapist. She has a background with the "Resource Institute for Human Rights," supported by UNICEF & Rajasthan Police, and is recognized for her optimistic and creative approach in supporting diverse individuals.

 About  National Academic Depository 
 The vision of National Academic Depository (NAD) is born out of an initiative to provide an online store house of all academic awards. National Academic Depository (NAD) is a 24X7 online store house of all academic awards viz.certificates, diplomas, degrees, mark-sheets etc. duly digitised and lodged by academic institutions / boards / eligibility assessment bodies. NAD not only ensures easy access to and retrieval of an academic award but also validates and guarantees its authenticity and safe storage.

 About Digi Locker 
 Digi Locker and NAD are initiatives of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Ministry of Education (MoE) respectively. The concept of National Academic Depository (NAD) is born out of an initiative by MoE to provide a 24X7 online depository to Academic institutions to store and publish their academic awards.  The digital depository not only ensures easy access to and retrieval of an academic award but also validates and guarantees its authenticity and safe storage. 
 Digi Locker is a provider of NAD services and aims at ‘Digital Empowerment’ of citizen by providing access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document wallet. The issued documents in Digi Locker system are deemed to be at par with original physical documents as per Rule 9A of the Information Technology (Preservation and Retention of Information by Intermediaries providing Digital Locker facilities) Rules, 2016. 
 Maintaining academic awards in an electronic depository would provide benefit to educational institutions, students and employers by enabling online access of academic awards which will eliminate the need for persons to approach educational institutions for obtaining transcripts of such awards for verification. It would also eliminate fraudulent practices such as forging of awards, by facilitating online verification thereof and maintains the authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the award. 
 It aspires to make the vision of Digital Academic awards for every Indian a reality.

 JK Lakshmipat University is dedicated to fostering a safe and supportive environment where staff, faculty, and students can work collaboratively without fear of violence, harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. This commitment extends to all forms of gender violence, sexual harassment, and discrimination based on sex or gender.
