For awarding scholarships based on CUET performance, the score will be computed as follows:
Moreover, there is a fee reduction initiative for certain student categories, capped at a maximum of 100 percent. A 25% reduction in academic fees is applied to the following individuals:

This award is granted annually, subject to the conditions outlined in the rules for continuation.

Students falling into the following categories will be entitled to a scholarship equivalent to 10 percent of the academic fee in the first year if they do not qualify for any above mentioned scholarships. This is applicable only for the initial year of studies:
In addition to the existing scholarships, including women’s scholarships and special category scholarships (subject to a maximum of 100 percent), JKLU offers Early Bird Scholarships.
All scholarships are expressed as a percentage of Academic Fees exclusively. No scholarship covers Technology Fee, Hostel, Transport, and Mess charges.
The scholarship will be sustained for the subsequent year based on performance in the program at JKLU.
Note:

A 25 percent scholarship for the dependents of JKO employees and siblings of students/alumni (including alumni pursuing a second degree) will persist as long as they maintain a CGPA of 6.0. This scholarship will be in addition to the merit scholarship mentioned earlier, subject to a maximum of 100 percent.
The 10 percent women’s scholarship will be ongoing for all eligible women who do not receive any other scholarship, provided they maintain a minimum CGPA of 6.0.
Disciplinary Committee
The disciplinary committee and the unfair means committee hold the authority to propose a reduction or discontinuation of a scholarship if a student is found culpable of breaching academic integrity (such as copying or assisting others in assignments, projects, exams, etc., or engaging in plagiarism or similar acts) or violating disciplinary norms (including theft, fighting, property defacement, substance abuse, etc.). In the initial instance, the scholarship will default to a lower level, and it will be entirely revoked after a second violation. However, these committees retain the discretion to recommend no impact on the scholarship (if deeming charges as minor violations) or suggest scholarship removal in the first instance itself (if charges are considered serious).
