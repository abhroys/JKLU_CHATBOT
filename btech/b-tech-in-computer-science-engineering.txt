Objective
This program aims to provide a strong foundation in Mathematics, Problem solving and Critical thinking, and Programming in addition to the courses on Design and Management while laying adequate emphasis on the core subjects of Computer Science and Engineering. Macro credit courses on emerging technologies are offered to equip the students with the skills and knowledge need to stay at the forefront of their fields. A mandatory two months Practice School-1 at the end of the second year and six months Practice School-2 in the final year allows them to get practical knowledge and valuable insight into the world of Computer Science and Engineering. Well-equipped labs and research facilities along with an excellent faculty provide the necessary pathways to aid the process of learning.

Career Prospects
Designed to create innovators of tomorrow, this programme prepares the students to take on challenging careers in the fields of technology research, software design and development, system and network architecture, system integration and many more.

Minors (Interdisciplinary)
For students interested in expanding their horizons beyond their primary field of engineering, minors offer a valuable opportunity. Minors complement the main degree and can enhance employability, facilitate interdisciplinary learning, or serve as a stepping stone to further education.

 

The minors currently offered at the institute include:

Design
Banking in Fintech
Entrepreneurship
Robotics
Mathematics
Successfully completed specializations and minors are prominently noted on the students’ degree certificates alongside their main field of study. This recognition highlights their additional qualifications and can significantly enhance their profiles for potential employers or academic opportunities.
