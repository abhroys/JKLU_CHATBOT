Objective
This program aims to provide a strong foundation in Probability and Statistics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies along with courses in Computer science, Design and Management. The students will be exposed to cutting- edge AI technologies such as Large Language Models (ChatGPT, BARD, LLAMA), Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. A mandatory two months Practice School-1 at the end of the second year and six months Practice School-2 in the final year allows them to get practical knowledge and valuable insight into the world of Computer Science and AI. Well-equipped labs and research facilities along with an excellent faculty further provide the necessary pathways to aid the process of learning

Career Prospects
Designed to create innovators of tomorrow, this programme prepares the students to take on challenging careers in the application of AI in varied fields such as HealthCare, Analytics, FinTech, Transportation and E- commerce etc.

Minors (Interdisciplinary)
For students interested in expanding their horizons beyond their primary field of engineering, minors offer a valuable opportunity. Minors complement the main degree and can enhance employability, facilitate interdisciplinary learning, or serve as a stepping stone to further education.

 

The minors currently offered at the institute include:

Design
Banking in Fintech
Entrepreneurship
Robotics
Mathematics
Successfully completed specializations and minors are prominently noted on the students’ degree certificates alongside their main field of study. This recognition highlights their additional qualifications and can significantly enhance their profiles for potential employers or academic opportunities.
