Objective
The field of Computer and Communication Engineering is evolving at accelerated pace with convergence of computers and communication systems. This requires engineers to have skills in Programming as well as capability to update in cutting edge technologies like Internet of Things, 5G and Wireless technologies, VLSI. This program aims to provide a strong foundation in Computer Science, Communication Technology along with Design and Management courses, while providing flexibility for Discipline /Interdisciplinary Specializations. A mandatory two months Practice School-1 at the end of the second year and six months Practice School-2 in the final year allows them to get practical knowledge and valuable insight into the world of Computer Science and Communication Technology. Well-equipped labs and research facilities along with an excellent faculty provide the necessary pathways to aid the process of learning.

Career Prospects
Designed to create innovators of tomorrow, this programme prepares the students to take on challenging careers in the fields of communication system design. and maintenance, link budget, security and performance monitoring.
