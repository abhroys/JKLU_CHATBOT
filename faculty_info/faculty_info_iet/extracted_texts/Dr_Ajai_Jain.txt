--- Experience ---
Prof. Ajai Jain is Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Engineering and Technology, JKLU. He has more than 35 years of teaching experience at IIT Delhi (Lecturer, 1981-86), BITS Pilani (Assistant Professor, 1991-92) and IIT Kanpur (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor, 1992-2020). He also holds 30 years of post-PhD research experience supervising many B.Tech./ M.Tech./ PhD Students.Prof. Jain has been associated with numerous activities related to Continuing Education. He coordinated summer schools for students and faculty members from Engineering colleges during the summer of 1999 and 2000, training approximately 300 and 700 participants respectively. He was instrumental in organising continuing education activities in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi during early 80s where he conducted short term courses on VLSI Testing. He is credited with conducting several training programmes for IBM-ACE and Cadence. VLSI testing for the teachers from engineering colleges in October 2001 under MIT VLSI manpower project were also conducted by him.During his vast academic experience, Prof. Jain has held the position of Group Leader (HoD) at BITS Pilani. He was also a Member of The Board of Governors, IIT Kanpur. He held the positions of Chairman of Senate Undergraduate Committee, Chairman of Senate Postgraduate Committee, Chairman of Rules Committee and Senate Parliamentarian at IIT Kanpur. He has chaired sessions in national and International conferences, symposiums and workshops. He served on the selection committees of IITs, NITs, UPSC and other government organisations. He was also the Chairman of RDC and Member of Board for Curriculum Development of various universities and Engineering colleges.
