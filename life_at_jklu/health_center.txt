Mindery: On-Campus Counselling Service
At JK Lakshmipat University, we recognize that student life can be both enriching and challenging, often involving adaptation to new environments, deadline management, and complex social interactions. To assist our students, we offer 'Mindery,' an on-campus counseling service aimed at helping students manage anxiety and adjust effectively to campus life.

Mindery Technologies provides these counseling services, which are confidential and available during designated hours. Mindery offers 24/7 online access, with in-person counseling available every Thursday from 9 AM to 5 PM. Students must pre-book their 45-minute sessions via a weekly campus life email. We uphold strict confidentiality and take immediate action if necessary. Additionally, Mindery conducts both online and offline educational sessions on mental health to boost students' self-awareness and confidence.

Our in-house counselor, Ms. Pallavee Sharma, Senior Executive - Wellness (Student Affairs), is a Counseling Psychologist and Art Therapist.
